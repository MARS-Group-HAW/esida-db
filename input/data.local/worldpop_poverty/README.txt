_______________________

DATASET: Alpha version 2010 estimates of proportion of people per grid square living in poverty, as defined by the Multidimensional Poverty Index (http://www.ophi.org.uk/policy/multidimensional-poverty-index/), and $1.25 a day and $2 a day thresholds, and associated uncertainty metrics.
REGION: Africa
SPATIAL RESOLUTION: 0.00833333 decimal degrees (approx 1km at the equator)
PROJECTION: Geographic, WGS84
UNITS: Proportion of residents living in MPI-defined poverty (poverty dataset), and on $1.25 and $2 a day (poverty dataset); 95% credible interval (uncertainty dataset)
MAPPING APPROACH: Bayesian model-based geostatistics in combination with high resolution gridded spatial covariates applied to GPS-located household survey data on poverty from the DHS and/or LSMS programs.
FORMAT: Geotiff (zipped using 7-zip (open access tool): www.7-zip.org)
FILENAMES: Examples - nga10povcons125.tif = Nigeria (nga) consumption-based poverty map for 2010 showing proportion of residents living on less than $1.25 a day. nga10povcons125-uncert.tif = uncertainty dataset showing 95% credible intervals.
